All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- CI: upgrade `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to v5 (Node 20 deprecation warning resolved).
- CI: Node runtime bumped from 20 → 22.
- CI now runs `test:coverage` and uploads a coverage artifact on every push.
- New `test:coverage` npm script for local coverage runs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Bulk operations** on the store: `removeTasks(ids)` and `shiftTasks(ids, deltaDays)` — single undo step per call.
- **Delete/Backspace keyboard shortcut** — removes currently selected tasks (ignored when focus is in an input/textarea).
- **`slots.renderHeaderCell`** — override the content of timeline header cells.
- **Context menu multi-select** — shows "Delete (N)" when more than one task is selected (requires `onDeleteSelection` prop wired by the consumer).

### Changed
- Tests: 170 → 177 (+7 bulkOps suite).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Drag constraints** on `GanttTask`: `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `lockStart`, `lockEnd`, `noOverlap`. Enforced during move, resize-start, and resize-end.
- **Custom left-pane columns** via `slots.columns` prop. Falls back to default column set when omitted.
- **Custom task bar renderer** via `slots.renderTaskBar` — returns ReactNode rendered inside the bar wrapper.
- Public `GanttSlots` type export.

### Changed
- Bumped tests from 160 → 170.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `labels` prop on `<Gantt>` for i18n — override any UI string (defaults are English).
- New `minutes` zoom preset (15-minute cells) for operational/logistics planning.
- `useNow` hook — now-line in Markers refreshes every minute without external rerender.
- Public `GanttLabels` type + `DEFAULT_LABELS` export.

### Changed
- Default date-fns locale switched from Dutch (`nl`) to English (`en-US`).
- All hardcoded Dutch UI strings replaced with i18n lookups (toolbar, task editor, context menu, grid columns, export button, dependency link delete).
- Added more npm keywords for discovery (`resource-scheduling`, `swimlanes`, `react-timeline`).
